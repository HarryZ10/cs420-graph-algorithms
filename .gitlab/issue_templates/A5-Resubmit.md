# Assignment 5: Minimum Spanning Tree

You will need to **resubmit** your code after you fix the following issues:

* [problem on line 1](../-/blob/a5/src/main/scala/graph.scala#L1)
* [problem on line 2](../-/blob/a5/src/main/scala/graph.scala#L2)


Once you have fixed these problems, commit and push your code. **Reply** to this issue, briefly describe what you did to fix the issues, and **assign** the issue to me.
